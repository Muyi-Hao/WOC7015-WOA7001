## Meeting on Sunday, 11 December 2022

1. Data structure concern
   - what is the constraint of the PLC for data storage?
   - how to orchestrate the data for the executation of task?
   - possible implementation of database?
   - OSIsoft PI System
   - what are the interface requirement for the team to develop the module to be used in the system?
2. Machine Learning Library
   - is it feasible to run in PLC or arduino?
