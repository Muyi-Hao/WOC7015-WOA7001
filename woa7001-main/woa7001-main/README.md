## Define Problems

- Heavy workload and not ergonomic to human.
- Accuracy and reliability of the process is low.
- If no automation is implemented, packaging efficiency is low.
- Not hygienic due to human involvement.
- Existing packaging technology or tool occupy large spaces and does not provide modularity or mobility for integration with other automation.

## List of resources related to problem

- The repetitive process can be automated to improve the working environment, however, such structural change would also generate new issue to be resolved. One of them, as mentioned article [Human Factors and Ergonomics in Automation Design](./resources/LeeSeppelt_2012_Humanfactorsandergonomicsinautomationdesign.pdf), "Automation often fails to provide expected benefits because it does not simply replace the human in performing a task but also transforms the job and introduces new tasks."
- Food packaging automation can improve, safety, productivity, flexibility, scalability, operating cost, consistency of production, and end-to-end traceability of the process. [Automation in The Food Packaging Industry â€“ Trends and Benefits](https://www.pwrpack.com/food-packaging-automation/)
- The [DCS Series Rice Packing Machine](https://rice-processing.com/dcs-series-rice-packing-machine.html) shows that the rice packing has a dimension of more than 700 $*$ 600 $*$ 2500 mm and it also requires extra equipment to transport the rice, [Bucket Elevator](https://rice-processing.com/dtg-series-bucket-elevator.html).
